Still going through the tutorials. Will do it by tomorrow though.<adeepak> : Ok cool<yashguest> : hi everyone<Puneet> : hello<adeepak> : Puneet and samvid wanna talk about your experience with the programming<suhasbs> : Hi. Whens the session starting<yashguest> : yes plz puneeth n samvid, tell us abt it<Puneet> : I did it in c, it was tough in the beginning, all the random structures didn't make sense. But the site went through the code line by line, it made sense at the end.<yashguest> : nice<Samvid> : Same here<Puneet> : The site had explanation for almost every function it used. It took a lot of my time for me to understand.<adeepak> : Tell us about the functions you used<Samvid> : I followed a tutorial on youtube that gave each of the structure definitions<yashguest> : ya....i also read the structures and understood quite a bit,still hav to try n implement it<Puneet> : important functions were, socket(),bind(),listen(),accept(),read(),write()<Samvid> : Well, the first thing was to create a socket with the socket() function, then bind it with the bind(). The make the server listen on that socket using listen(). When a client connection has been made, accept it with accept()<Samvid> : And use send() and recv() to send and receive data<Samvid> : Guess read() and write() can also be used<Puneet> : but i still understand some of the things like why did we used 5 in the listen() function<adeepak> : We will come to that, first samvid what was the last argument ie flag you used in send recv<Puneet> : @Samvid, we can use send() and recv()?<Samvid> : Im not sure of that
