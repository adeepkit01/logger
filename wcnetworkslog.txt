<ankit> : hello<Samvid> : hello!<ankit> : s/Guest45174 please rejoin with a different name<ankit> : let us wait for sometime <ankit> : ok everyone up?<Samvid> : yup<venkat> : yes<ankit> : ok so one or two more are joining I guess <ankit> : till then, how many of you know any basic stuff about networks? <Samvid> : I know some basics<venkat> : just some basics of packets...<krishna_> : which language will be used for socket programming?<ankit> : we will come to socket programming maybe at the end of this session or in the next session <krishna_> : okay<ankit> : we will need to get a few basic concepts though <pun> : I'm new to networks.<ankit> : I am gonna assume everyone of you are <satish_> : Okay<ankit> : if someone has experience before, please bear with me <ankit> : sorry for the delay, its due to the connection problem you can see on whatsapp <sh___> : @ankit : Has the session started?<ankit> : not yet, some people were facing trouble with the joining process <sh___> : ok cool<sh___> : Who is Mr. OSI?<ankit> : that's the bot <sh___> : lol ok<sh___> : 5 more to join rite?<ankit> : ok we will start <ankit> : I was waiting for the log to sync <ankit> : so yea, like any conventional classroom lets start with, What's network?<pun> : computers interconnected?<Samvid> : group of interconnected devices<sh___> : What do u mean by connected ?<Suhag> : the devices can communicate and exchange information with each other somehow<sh___> : Yup<sh___> : Anyone knows what's a port<Samvid> : dont know the formal definition<sh___> : alright u can just say it's purpose<krishna_> : location where network can physically connect<sh___> : yup<sh___> : and ip ?<Samvid> : oh i thought you were talking about virtual ports<sh___> : no I haven't reached there yet<Puneet> : ip addresses are used to identify each device on a network?<Samvid> : ip - internet protocol<krishna_> : location of computer in network<ankit> : ok many of you would have come across port a few minutes back <sh___> : ok i meant ip address<ankit> : I know Puneet did <ankit> : and same goes for IP addresses <Puneet> : I did. :D<ankit> : so all this are identifier, before we go to them let's understand the organisation of networks <ankit> : A computer network follow a layered structure <ankit> : Any network enthusiast came across the word OSI before?<Samvid> : yup<ankit> : what do you know about it?<Samvid> : its a model to describe networks and network communications, sort of<ankit> : ok kinda, it's a "theoritical" model which specifies network as  7 layered model <ankit> : the current network follows a similar architecture with 5 layers <ankit> : Physical, Data link, Network, Transport and Application <sh___> : Basically it describes the various phases of data transfer between 2 systems<ankit> : ok whats application of networking?<Suhag> : data transfer, communication, shared resources<sh___> : yup<ankit> : That's weird, most of them say multi player gming now a days <Suhag> : lol<Samvid> : that differentiates kids from college students :P<ankit> : so yea transfer needs a sender and a receiver <ankit> : right?<Samvid> : yeah<sh___> : sender - sends data and receiver - receives data<sh___> : If you have to send a post to someone, u need to know their address<sh___> : that's why we have ip addresses<ankit> : and address is like house, street, city, state right?<sh___> : so ur house number is like port<sh___> : and socket is ip address + port number<ankit> : A general user interact with network using applications <ankit> : a very simple example of application?<ankit> : hint: you are using it right now <ankit> : ??<Samvid> : chat applications?<ankit> : yes <ankit> : so user interact with applications <ankit> : applications run on a port 6667 is the preferred port for IRC <ankit> : port are connected to IP addresses <ankit> : and hence port+IP becomes your network identifier <Puneet> : application runs on a port or a device connects through a single port?<ankit> : You have 65536 port in your system <ankit> : one application has one port <shr> : the first 1024 ports are reserved ports<ankit> : for well known applications <ankit> : 9 for ping <ankit> : 8080 for HTTPS<ankit> : and so on <shr> : Any doubts?<ankit> : a socket is an abstract implementation of the whole network stack <shr> : What do u understand when he uses the term abstract<Suhag> : the socket is not a physical thing<Puneet> : Ports are virtual?<ankit> : no Ports are physical <ankit> : you have that many ports in your hardware <ankit> : or you can call it logical <shr> : http://averma82.blogspot.in/2013/05/what-is-portnumber-logical-port.html<shr> : read that <ankit> : so yea back to socket <ankit> : in a very vague term its combination of ip address and port <ankit> : Every application has to create a socket to use network <ankit> : so the first assignment is a socket programme <ankit> : The preferred language is C <shr> : has anyone done socket programming before?<ankit> : and please don't use python
