We ll start when everybody joins. <vilas_m> : So i guess we ll start.<vilas_m> : Today we will cover STL containers and if time permits, get started with a bit of number theory required for competitive coding<vilas_m> : Can someone point out what is a container, first of all?<vilas_m> : Ok, so in simple terms, something which can hold data is called a container<vilas_m> : First we shall deal with vectors<vilas_m> : Vectors are very similar to arrays, except that they can change their size at any time. <vilas_m> : To use them, insert #include<vector> in your code <vilas_m> : Or if you're using bits/stdc++.h already, then thats fine too
