<ujdcodr> : Welcome to the first session of the Winter Mentorship Program 2017<ujdcodr> : I'll wait for 5 mins<ujdcodr> : until then you can just reply "Connected" so that i know that the channel is working<Ravali> : Connected<dharma> : connected<Swastik> : connected<Shivani> : Connected<ujdcodr> : OK<ujdcodr> : Let's begin<ujdcodr> : Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed<ujdcodr> : That's the layman's way of defining Machine Learning<ujdcodr> : You want an automaton to learn how to solve a task on its own by training it<ujdcodr> : But how do i phrase this is a more "mathematically aesthetic" way<ujdcodr> : Let's look at what a "well posed learning problem" is:<ujdcodr> : "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."<ujdcodr> : take a minute to read this and understand it<ujdcodr> : sounds very poetic doesn't it?<ujdcodr> : everyone done with reading the definition?<dharma> : ya<ujdcodr> : I'll explain this once everyone is done<Shivani> : yes<Swastik> : yes<Ravali> : done<Prabhjot> : Yes<ujdcodr> : so over here "T" is the problem you want to solve<ujdcodr> : "E" is what the learning program has "learnt" after conducting several tests on the given dataset<ujdcodr> : And your performance measure "P" is like a probability value<ujdcodr> : this value should improve(as in tend closer to 1 or 0) depending on the type of problem posed<ujdcodr> : Let me illustrate with an example<ujdcodr> : Suppose you've made a program that classifies your mail as Spam and Not Spam<ujdcodr> : and you run this on a dataset of a 100000 emails<ujdcodr> : this number can be arbitrary<ujdcodr> : T would be the task of of "correctly" classifying an email as SPAM or NOT SPAM<ujdcodr> : you must be very clear, the emails are already labeled(so we know as humans what kind of mail is and is not spam)<ujdcodr> : but the algorithm doesn't<ujdcodr> : So you know the right answer<ujdcodr> : and your algorithm should produce the right answer for a good "fraction" of the test cases <ujdcodr> : So the experience "E" over here will be the algorithm learning how an email is classified as SPAM or NOT SPAM<ujdcodr> : like i said, we are feeding the "right answers" from a lot of training examples<ujdcodr> : and the algo should figure out, "given a new email, should i classify it as spam or not spam"<ujdcodr> : has everyone followed upto now<ujdcodr> : you can raise doubts at any point of time<ujdcodr> : Is the definition of "a well defined problem" clear to all?<Ravali> : yeah<Swastik> : yep<ujdcodr> : because i'm going to pose a question after this<Prabhjot> : Yes<Shivani> : yes<dharma> : yes, little confusion in feeding the "right answers" from a lot of training examples<ujdcodr> : Your dataset will contain a bunch of emails<ujdcodr> : each one will be labeled SPAM or NOT SPAM<dharma> : ok<ujdcodr> : there are certain characteristics of an email that determine whether it's spam or not<ujdcodr> : think about how you normally would classify such an email<ujdcodr> : maybe a promotional offer from FLIPKART<ujdcodr> : is spam<ujdcodr> : an email from a friend isn't spam<ujdcodr> : both emails have different structure and characteristics<ujdcodr> : and the algo "learns" these characteristics<dharma> : ok got it<ujdcodr> : so the next time it receives an email, it'll do the classification for you<ujdcodr> : clear><dharma> : yes<ujdcodr> : so now for the question<ujdcodr> : In the given example can someone tell me what "P" is?<ujdcodr> : think about it<Prabhjot> : Whether it is spam or not spam<Shivani> : It's the probability that the machine will classify the email correctly as spam or not spam?<Ravali> : the number of correct classifications?<Swastik> : Probability that it classifies it correctly?<dharma> : fraction correct  answer by machin<ujdcodr> : That's correct, looks like you've already done the course. What are you here for then? XD XD <ujdcodr> : Jokes apart the performance measure "P" has to improve, right? So the only thing that can improve is the accuracy with which the algo determines whether an email is SPAM or NOT SPAM<ujdcodr> : and this is reflected in the Probability of the algo's answer matching the "right" answer<ujdcodr> : which is nothing but the fraction of correctly classified emails<ujdcodr> : So i hope this is clear to everyone?<Ravali> : yes<dharma> : yes<arvind97> : Yeah<Swastik> : yeah<Shivani> : yes<Prabhjot> : Yes<ujdcodr> : people who were late, logs of the session will be uploaded after the session(url will be shared on the whatsapp group)<VS> : Yes<ujdcodr> : So there are 2 types of "Learning" methodologies<ujdcodr> : One is Supervised Learning and the other is Unsupervised Learning<ujdcodr> : The difference is very intuitive<ujdcodr> : The example i just demonstrated was that of Supervised learning<ujdcodr> : The dataset was already labeled with the "right"and "wrong" answers<ujdcodr> : so this helped the algorithm learn how to predict easily <Vikram> : What does algo do if emails are already labelled and what actually accuracy mean then?<ujdcodr> : The algorithm learns what the characteristics of an email classified as SPAM<ujdcodr> : it works just like a human<ujdcodr> : a promotional email from flipkart is obviously different in structure than an email from your friend<ujdcodr> : the algorithm is "trained" by the labeled dataset<Shivani> : What if I repeatedly report a friend's email as spam? Does that give algo experience to mark it as spam?<ujdcodr> : now when i throw a brand new "unlabeled" email at my algorithm, it should be able to tell whether the email is SPAM or NOT SPAM based on it characteristic features(which it learnt from the dataset)<ujdcodr> : Yes there are many factors as to classifying an email as spam(not just one or two)<Shivani> : Okay.<dharma> : what kind of parameters(characteristic feature) does the algorithm uses to learn in this example?<ujdcodr> : the algorithm will note that an email received from "XYZ@gmail.com" is labelled as spam most of the time <ujdcodr> : so i know that when i receive an email from this email id, it "should" go to the SOPAM folder<dharma> : okey it will only look at the email id not the contents like images attached ... right??<ujdcodr> : @dharma i don't make the algorithms, but email address, frequency and a particular style of header could be a few of the many parameters involved<dharma> : okey got it<ujdcodr> : And that dataset is fed in by humans<ujdcodr> : so the algo will learn to filter these emails "almost" like us<ujdcodr> : clear<ujdcodr> : ?<dharma> : yes
