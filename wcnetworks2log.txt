<Guest20692> : it should be fine right?<ankit__> : Should be fine, who is it by the way? It shows me Guest20692<Guest20692> : Yash<Guest20692> : i donno y the nickname changes on its own<Guest20692> :  -NickServ- You failed to identify in time for the nickname Yash<Guest20692> : tats the error it shows<adeepak> : Let everyone join<adeepak> : Siddhanth did you try the program?<siddhanth> : no, not yet. Still going through the tutorials. Will do it by tomorrow though.<adeepak> : Ok cool<yashguest> : hi everyone<Puneet> : hello<adeepak> : Puneet and samvid wanna talk about your experience with the programming<suhasbs> : Hi. Whens the session starting<yashguest> : yes plz puneeth n samvid, tell us abt it<Puneet> : I did it in c, it was tough in the beginning, all the random structures didn't make sense. But the site went through the code line by line, it made sense at the end.<yashguest> : nice<Samvid> : Same here<Puneet> : The site had explanation for almost every function it used. It took a lot of my time for me to understand.<adeepak> : Tell us about the functions you used<Samvid> : I followed a tutorial on youtube that gave each of the structure definitions<yashguest> : ya....i also read the structures and understood quite a bit,still hav to try n implement it<Puneet> : important functions were, socket(),bind(),listen(),accept(),read(),write()<Samvid> : Well, the first thing was to create a socket with the socket() function, then bind it with the bind(). The make the server listen on that socket using listen(). When a client connection has been made, accept it with accept()<Samvid> : And use send() and recv() to send and receive data<Samvid> : Guess read() and write() can also be used<Puneet> : but i still understand some of the things like why did we used 5 in the listen() function<adeepak> : We will come to that, first samvid what was the last argument ie flag you used in send recv<Puneet> : @Samvid, we can use send() and recv()?<Samvid> : Im not sure of that<Samvid> : I dont know the PF_INET and AF_INET parameters as well<Samvid> : @Puneet, yeah it seems so<adeepak> : Read write are send recv with flag 0<Puneet> : AF_INET is supposed to be Address Family for the server to be hosted in the internet?<adeepak> : Af inet is address family, to define the network address of socket<adeepak> : Pf inet was supposed to be protocol family, a subset of af but was not implemented<Puneet> : AF_INET doesnt really host it on the internet? <adeepak> : Someone asked me in mail about hosting on internet who was it?<Puneet> : Me, i think.<ankit__> : ok <ankit__> : so say your are connected to internet and you have an IP x.x.x.x<ankit__> : whoever can see that IP, can connect to a socket connected to it <ankit__> : that's why I said your socket will be surely visible in LAN <Puneet> : so, my ip is visible only to those on LAN?<ankit__> : Your IP will be mostly translated to a public IP of your ISP at your service provider gateway <ankit__> : so beyond that point you need to know your Public IP and port to connect, we will discuss these concepts soon <Puneet> : Oh, okay.<suhasbs> : Was implementing the same in java, but I did not use any of the functions like bind(), listen() as others have. Just used accept()<ankit__> : first back to your listen doubt <ankit__> : yea Java abstract most of the functions <suhasbs> : Oh. Ok<ankit__> : that's why I put C as the preferred language for everyone to get the basic functions <ankit__> : if you do same in python, you can open a socket in 1 line <ankit__> : so yea, What do you think is the work of listen? I mentioned something in my mail <ankit__> : I am connected right?<sh__> : yea<Puneet> : connected to the port? yea i think<ankit__> : ok so yea what do you think is the work of listen?<Samvid> : listen() is to wait for incoming connections?<Puneet> : yea that.
