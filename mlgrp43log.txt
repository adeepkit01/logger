<ujdcodr> : Let us begin<ujdcodr> : So does everyone remember that creepy looking sigmoid function? We're going to talk more about it<ujdcodr> : 1/(1+e^-x)<ujdcodr> : and the cost function is rewritten as y*(- log ( hyp )) + (1-y) * (- log ( 1 - hyp ))<ujdcodr> : no doubts about this right?<ujdcodr> : when y=1 we get the first half, when y=0 we get the second half of the cost function<ujdcodr> : where hyp is the sigmoid function<ujdcodr> : http://www.holehouse.org/mlclass/12_Support_Vector_Machines_files/Image%20[5].png<ujdcodr> : take a look at the image<ujdcodr> : it's just a plot when y=1 and hyp is substitued with the sigmoid function<ujdcodr> : *substituted<ujdcodr> : http://www.holehouse.org/mlclass/12_Support_Vector_Machines_files/Image%20[6].png<ujdcodr> : and this is when y=0<ujdcodr> : has everyone seen the image?<Swastik> : yeah<ujdcodr> : because we are going to define a new cost function<ujdcodr> : a small modification<ujdcodr> : http://www.holehouse.org/mlclass/12_Support_Vector_Machines_files/Image%20[7].png<ujdcodr> : http://www.holehouse.org/mlclass/12_Support_Vector_Machines_files/Image%20[8].png<ujdcodr> : notice the region of the curve that has been thresholded<ujdcodr> : in the first image anything beyond 1 is directly set to 0<ujdcodr> : and in the second image anything before -1 is set to 0<ujdcodr> : and then we have a straight line<ujdcodr> : how is all this helpful?<ujdcodr> : it Gives the SVM a computational advantage and an easier optimization problem<ujdcodr> : since the values are more clear and discrete, the algorithm will have an easier time computing the "right" result<ujdcodr> : everyone clear?<ujdcodr> : with the original and modified cost functions?<Swastik> : yeah<dharma> : yes<VS> : Yes<ujdcodr> : questions? anyone? This has a lot of math internally, but we're not going to go there<ujdcodr> : just understand that this modification reduces computational complexity<ujdcodr> : So what i defined here is an SVM cost function<Swastik> : How is better than the original one?<ujdcodr> : it works like a threshold<Swastik> : okay<ujdcodr> : there won't be values confused between 0 and 1<ujdcodr> : you will get either 0 or whatever lies on the slope of that straight line<Swastik> : Got it<ujdcodr> : which is much better than dealing with constantly varying values ona logarithmic curve right?<Swastik> : yeah<ujdcodr> : Moving on<ujdcodr> : What exactly is an SVM?<ujdcodr> : for that i'll have to tell you what a support vector is<ujdcodr> : https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SVM_1.png<ujdcodr> : take a look<ujdcodr> : Support Vectors are simply the co-ordinates of individual observation.<ujdcodr> : they are just your "yes" and "no" that are graphed<ujdcodr> : That line that divides the 2 clusters is the "Machine"
