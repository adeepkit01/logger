<ishaan> : Hello! I'm Ishaan. 1st Year Comps<Ashwin> : What's today's session about.? <vilas_m> : Hey guys! Sorry for the delay. Was waiting to see if your batchmates are going to join<ishaan> : Competetive coding<vilas_m> : So, we have a wonderful attendance today I see :P <vilas_m> : Are both of you comfortable with C++? <ishaan> : I am<Anirudh_> : yes<Ashwin> : Yes <vilas_m> : Great! :) <vilas_m> : So, did you guys try the problems posted on the group? Any issues?<vilas_m> : Be quick in responding guys. Otherwise, this will get boring :P <ishaan> : sorry I couldn't try the problems<Anirudh_> : No didnt try<vilas_m> : Alright. But do try them soon and approach any of the mentors for help :) <ishaan> : Sure!<Anirudh_> : OK<vilas_m> : Ok, if you guys have seen the problems, you might have realised that many problems have several test cases for the input. <vilas_m> : What do you do for dealing with several test cases? <vilas_m> : Simple. Just write <vilas_m> : cin>>T; (or scanf("%d", &T); for C users )<vilas_m> : while(T--)<vilas_m> : {<vilas_m> : }<vilas_m> : Your code goes inside the flower brackets<ishaan> : ok!<vilas_m> : When you are coding on competitive programming platforms, one thing to realise is that - the inputs and outputs are dealt with in seperate files.<vilas_m> : What I mean to say is, the input is read from the stdin file and the output is written stdout file by default.<Ashwin> : Ok<vilas_m> : This gives us a really good advantage. Can anyone guess what it is?
