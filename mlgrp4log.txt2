<ankit_> : It first pushes after 10 messages I will share the log link then <vadi> : ok awesome<ujdcodr> : why are there 2 Prabhjots?<Prabhjot_> : sorry one wasnt working<ujdcodr> : people remember to use "/quit" when you want to exit the channel anytime<ujdcodr> : without the quotes<ujdcodr> : that will safely disconnect you from the server<ankit_> : If he is unble to use it because of network issues quit won't work either <vadi> : ok so ill start. all there?<random> : testing<random> : This is Ujjwal<random> : Everyone connected?<Shivani> : yes<swastik> : Yep<Prabhjot_> : yes<VS> : Yes<random> : great!! all set<Vikram> : Yes<vadi> : ok ill begin now<vadi> : So thanks for coming and showing more interest in Machine learning<vadi> : If you haven't understood anything in the last session pls let us know now<vadi> : As logistic regression is pretty similar to the way linear regression works<vadi> : i'll recap a bit first<vadi> : basicall machine learning has 3 main types<vadi> : supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning<vadi> : in supervised we know the target labels (eg hosing prices given area etc)<vadi> : in unsupervised we dont know much about the data ( eg clustering news articles into sports, politics etc)<vadi> : in reinforcement learning the algorithm get penalized to gets rewarded for decisions it made ( used in alpha go and chess engines)<vadi> : in these sessions we will concentrate on the first 2 only<vadi> : again in supervised we have 2 categories<vadi> : 1) Regression<vadi> : 2) Classification<vadi> : Yesterday you learn an algorithm to handle regression problems where there result variable was continuous<vadi> : In classification problems the result variable is discrete<vadi> : for eg classify an image as bicycle/car<vadi> : the result falls in multiple classes<vadi> : now assuming you ppl have understood linear regression lets consider a problem<vadi> : say we want to classify an email as spam or not using the number of time "congratulations" apperars in the mail<vadi> : say the data points are as shown https://awwapp.com/b/uwuhbxpk8/<vadi> : now can someone draw the line linear regression would have drawn? <vadi> : i hope you can see the drawing board?<vadi> : lol<vadi> : ok dont draw pls XD<vadi> : ok so the blue line shows the answer<vadi> : thats what liner regression would have done<vadi> : but say we had an anomaly<vadi> : see the red circle<vadi> : now if we apply linear regression we get the purple line<vadi> : so if we want to classify the email we need a threshold <vadi> : say we set it at 0.5<vadi> : so any point with a value > 0.5 is spam<vadi> : but the purple line is misclassifying spam datapoints<vadi> : the green border points get misclassified<vadi> : so linear regression is failing to classify in this case<vadi> : so we need a better algorithm that can classify data points into classes<vadi> : are you guys following till now?<vadi> : hello? xD<swastik> : Yeah<vadi> : so are you following?<vadi> : ok is there anything particular that needs clarification?
